This assignment consists of 4 questions. Templates
for each question are given in the numbered
list below:

1. Question 1 [RMarkdown](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/SFUStat305/Assignments/A1/A1Q1.Rmd) or [Jupyter notebook](LINK TO BE ADDED)
2. Question 2 [RMarkdown](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/SFUStat305/Assignments/A1/A1Q2.Rmd) or [Jupyter notebook](LINK TO BE ADDED)
3. Question 3 [RMarkdown](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/SFUStat305/Assignments/A1/A1Q3.Rmd) or [Jupyter notebook](LINK TO BE ADDED)
4. Question 4 [RMarkdown](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/SFUStat305/Assignments/A1/A1Q4.Rmd) or [Jupyter notebook](LINK TO BE ADDED)

**For each question** do the following:

* Download the question template to your computer.
To do so, click on the link to the RMarkdown
(`.Rmd`) file if
you use RStudio (Desktop or Cloud) or the 
Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) if you use Jupyter.
Look for and click the "Raw" button to see the 
file in its raw form. Use your browser's 
`File -> Save As`
feature to save the file to your computer.
* If your R interface is a server (RStudio Cloud or
Jupyter), upload the template to the server.
* Start your R interface and open the template.
* Change the name, student ID and date in the 
header of the template to your own.
* Add your answers to the template.
* When you are finished adding your
answers, knit (RStudio) or run (Jupyter) the 
document and save the output as a PDF file. 
    + RStudio Desktop users should knit their RMarkdown
    file to HTML, and then use their browser to print
    the HTML file to PDF.
    + RStudio Cloud users should 
    make the following change to the header of the template 
    (lines 1-6): replace the line
    `output: html_document` with `output: pdf_document`. Then
    knitting will produce a PDF file.
    + Jupyter users should follow the Stat Workshop 
    tutorials on printing assignments.
* Now follow the Stat Workshop's instructions for
uploading a question to Crowdmark.
