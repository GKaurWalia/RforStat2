Before you do parts (a) - (d), draw a histogram of the data. The histogram should be handed in with your assignment. 

**Answer to histogram question**

```{r}
uu<-url("http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~jgraham/Teaching/S305_18/Data/serzinc.txt")
serzinc <- read.table(uu,header=TRUE)
head(serzinc)
# Put your histogram commands here
```

(a) 
**Answer** 

Note: If you look at the `ch8-10.Rmd` demo, you will
see that confidence intervals 
can be constructed from summary statistics
and quantiles (the "do-it-yourself" method) or read
from the output of the
`t.test()` function. You won't 
get extra marks for do-it-yourself, so you might
as well use `t.test()`.
